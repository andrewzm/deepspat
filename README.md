Deep Compositional Spatial Models
=================================



Deep compositional spatial models are standard spatial covariance models coupled with an injective warping function of the spatial domain. The warping function is constructed through a composition of multiple elemental injective functions in a deep-learning framework. The package implements two cases for the univariate setting; first, when these warping functions are known up to some weights that need to be estimated, and, second, when the weights in each layer are random. In the multivariate setting only the former case is available.  Estimation and inference is done using TensorFlow, which makes use of graphics processing units.
