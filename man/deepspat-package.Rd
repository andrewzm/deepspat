\title{Deep compositional spatial models}
\description{
Deep compositional spatial models are standard low-rank spatial models coupled with a bijective warping function of the spatial domain.
The warping function is constructed through a composition of multiple elemental bijective functions in a deep-learning framework.
The package implements two cases; first, when these functions are known up to some weights that need to be estimated, and, second,
when the weights in each layer are random. Estimation and inference is done using TensorFlow, which makes use of graphical processing
units.
