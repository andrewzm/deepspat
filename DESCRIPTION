Description: Deep compositional spatial models are standard low-rank spatial 
             models coupled with a bijective warping function of the spatial 
             domain. The warping function is constructed through a composition 
             of multiple elemental bijective functions in a deep-learning 
             framework. The package implements two cases; first, when these 
             functions are known up to some weights that need to be estimated, 
             and, second, when the weights in each layer are random. Estimation 
             and inference is done using TensorFlow, which makes use of 
             graphical processing units.
